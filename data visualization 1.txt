# Distributional Plots
# Distributional plots, as the name suggests are type of plots that show the statistical distribution of data.
# The Dist Plot
# The distplot() shows the histogram distribution of data for a single column. The column name is passed as a parameter to the
# distplot() function.

# Let's see how the price of the ticket for each passenger is distributed.
sns.distplot(dataset['fare'])

# You can see that most of the tickets have been solved between 0-50 dollars. The line that you see represents the kernel
# density estimation. You can remove this line by passing False as the parameter for the kde attribute as shown below:


sns.distplot(dataset['fare'], kde=False)

# Now you can see there is no line for the kernel density estimation on the plot.
# You can also pass the value for the bins parameter in order to see more or less details in the graph

sns.distplot(dataset['fare'], kde=False, bins=10) #Here we set the number of bins to 10.

# In the output, you will see data distributed in 10 bins You can clearly see that for more than 700 passengers, the ticket price is
# between 0 and 50.
